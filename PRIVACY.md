Below is **boilerplate privacy policy content** you can paste into a `/privacy.html` page (or adapt into a section). It’s written to cover **guest use, accounts, chat, shared/virtual filesystem, and local browser storage**, plus common web basics.

> Not legal advice. You should tailor specifics (what you actually log/store, retention periods, vendors like Supabase/Firebase, analytics, etc.) before publishing.

# Privacy Policy (YoBASIC)

**Effective date:** [Month Day, Year]
**Last updated:** [Month Day, Year]

YoBASIC (“**YoBASIC**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”) is an education-focused coding tutorial and IDE. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have when you use our website and services (the “**Service**”).

## 1) Summary

* You can use YoBASIC **without creating an account**.
* If you create an account, we collect basic account information (such as email and username) to provide login, collaboration features, and security.
* If you use chat or shared files, we store the content you submit so collaboration works.
* Some data may be stored **locally in your browser** (for example, editor state or recent files) to improve your experience.

## 2) Information we collect

### A. Information you provide

**Guest usage (no account):**

* Code you type, settings you choose, and lesson progress may be stored **in your browser** (local storage or similar) to keep your session convenient.
* If you contact us (email/support), we collect the information you send (such as your name, email address, and message).

**Accounts (optional):**

* If you create an account, we may collect:

    * Email address
    * Username / display name
    * Password (stored in hashed form, if we manage passwords directly)
    * Profile details you choose to provide (optional)

**Chat and collaboration:**

* If you use shared chat, we collect and store:

    * Messages you post
    * Your display name and identifiers needed to show who posted what
    * Basic metadata like timestamps and room/channel identifiers

**Virtual/shared filesystem (if enabled):**

* If you save files to a shared or cloud-based workspace, we may collect and store:

    * File contents (your code, text, project files)
    * File names, folders, and version information
    * Sharing/collaboration metadata (who has access, timestamps, etc.)

### B. Information collected automatically

When you use the Service, we may automatically collect:

* **Device and usage data** (e.g., browser type, pages viewed, approximate location inferred from IP, date/time, referral URLs)
* **Log data** for security and reliability (e.g., IP address, request/response metadata, error logs)
* **Cookies or similar technologies** for session management, preferences, and security

> If you use YoBASIC without an account, we still collect limited technical/log data to keep the site secure and working.

## 3) How we use information

We use information to:

* Provide and operate the Service (run tutorials, compile/execute code, show results)
* Create and manage accounts (authentication, account recovery, fraud prevention)
* Enable collaboration features (chat, shared workspaces, shared files)
* Save preferences and improve user experience (including local browser storage)
* Maintain safety and security, prevent abuse, and debug issues
* Communicate with you (support replies, service announcements)
* Comply with legal obligations

## 4) Local browser storage (guest mode)

YoBASIC may store some information **on your device** (for example, in localStorage or IndexedDB) such as:

* Editor contents and session state
* UI preferences (theme, font size)
* Recent files or lesson progress

You can clear this data by clearing your browser storage/site data. If you clear it, you may lose local progress and drafts.

## 5) Chat content and community expectations

If chat is enabled:

* Messages may be visible to other users, depending on the chat room or community setting.
* Do not share sensitive personal information in public chats.
* We may remove content or suspend accounts to enforce safety and community rules.

## 6) Sharing and disclosure

We do **not** sell your personal information.

We may share information:

* **With service providers** who help us operate the Service (hosting, databases, authentication, analytics, email delivery). They are authorized to use information only as needed to provide services to us.
* **For legal and safety reasons** (e.g., comply with law, respond to lawful requests, protect rights, investigate abuse, or prevent harm).
* **In business transfers** (e.g., merger, acquisition, asset sale), where your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.

## 7) Data retention

We retain information only as long as necessary to provide the Service and for legitimate business purposes.

Typical examples:

* **Account information** is retained while your account is active.
* **Chat messages** and **shared files** may be retained to preserve collaboration history, unless you delete them (if deletion tools exist) or we remove them under moderation policies.
* **Logs** are retained for a limited period for security, debugging, and reliability.

You may request deletion of your account (see “Your choices” below). Some data may remain in backups for a limited time or as required by law.

## 8) Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 9) Children’s privacy

YoBASIC is designed for learning. If you allow minors to use YoBASIC, you are responsible for appropriate supervision and compliance with applicable laws.

If we learn that we collected personal information from a child without appropriate consent where required, we will take steps to delete it.

*(Optional: Add a specific age threshold and parental consent process if you target under-13 users in the U.S. or other jurisdictions.)*

## 10) International users

If you access the Service from outside the United States, you understand that your information may be processed and stored in the United States or other locations where our providers operate.

## 11) Your choices and rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to:

* Access, correct, or delete personal information
* Object to or restrict certain processing
* Receive a copy of your information (data portability)

**Account deletion:** You can request account deletion by contacting us at: **[[privacy@yobasic.com](mailto:privacy@yobasic.com)]** (replace with your real address).
**Browser storage:** You can clear local site data in your browser settings.

## 12) Cookies

We may use cookies or similar technologies for:

* Keeping you signed in (session cookies)
* Remembering preferences
* Security protections
* Analytics (if enabled)

You can control cookies through your browser settings. Some features may not work without cookies.

## 13) Third-party links and services

The Service may link to third-party sites (for example, Basil at basilbasic.com). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties. Review their policies before providing information.

## 14) Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date and, if changes are material, provide additional notice as required by law.

## 15) Contact us

If you have questions or requests about this Privacy Policy, contact:

**Blackrush LLC**
**Email:** [[privacy@yobasic.com](mailto:privacy@yobasic.com)]
**Address:** [Your business address]

## Optional add-ons (use only if true)

You can paste one or more of these sections in if they apply:

### A) “If you use AI features”

If YoBASIC includes AI-assisted coding or chat:

* Describe what text/code is sent to AI providers and whether it’s used for training.
* Provide an opt-out if possible.

### B) “Public projects”

If users can publish/share projects publicly:

* Explain what becomes public (username, project name, code, timestamps).

### C) “Deletion specifics”

If you will offer deletion of chat messages/files:

* Clarify whether deletion is permanent or “soft deleted” and how long backups persist.

Q. we’re using for **auth + database + chat** (e.g., Supabase, Firebase, custom PHP/MySQL, etc.) and whether guest code is stored only locally or also server-side, I can tighten this so it’s accurate to your stack and add a short “plain English” summary at the top.

A. Supabase for everything including chat.
