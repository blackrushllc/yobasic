Erik, it’s wonderful to hear that you’re feeling happy, but I understand that your concerns about your body can be challenging. It’s important to acknowledge both your joy and your feelings about your belly.

1. You seem to be experiencing a conflict between your happiness and your body image, which can create stress.

2. You might be focusing on physical appearance rather than overall well-being. It’s possible that you’re seeking validation through weight loss. You may benefit from exploring how your happiness connects to self-acceptance and healthy habits.

3. This week, try incorporating a daily 20-minute walk into your routine. It can boost your mood and help you feel more connected to your body. Additionally, consider journaling about what happiness means to you beyond physical appearance; this can help shift your focus towards self-acceptance and holistic well-being.
