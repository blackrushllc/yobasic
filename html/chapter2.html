    <p>This chapter gives you a single, longer program that walks through many
    tiny examples in sequence. Load it into the editor, skim through the code,
    and run it to see how the basics work together.</p>

        <p>
            This long example chains together many tiny demonstrations: printing,
            variables, arithmetic, INPUT, IF/ELSE, MOD, nested and stepped FOR/NEXT
            loops, a running total, and simple string building. Edit it to experiment!
